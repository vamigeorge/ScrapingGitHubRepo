# Instructions

We're going to scrape https://github.com/topics

We'll get a list of topics. For each topic title, topic page URL and topic description

For each topic, we'll get the top 5 repositories in the topic from the topic page.

For each repository we'll grab the repo name, username, stars and repo URL.

For each topic we'll create a CSV file in the following format:
Repo Name,UserName,Stars,Repo URL three.js,mrdoob,69700,https://github.com/mrdoob/three.jss
