# Instructions

I scraped https://github.com/topics

And i did that by getting a list of topics, For each topic title, topic page URL and topic description

For each topic, i got the top 5 repositories in that topic from the topic page.

For each repository i grabbed the repo name, username, stars and repo URL.

Then For each topic i created a CSV file in the following format:
Repo Name,UserName,Stars,Repo URL three.js,mrdoob,69700, https://github.com/mrdoob/three.jss
